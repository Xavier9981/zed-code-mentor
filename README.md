# Zed Code Mentor
This is my personal blog site where I share unbiased articles on web development for beginners in Zambia. The website is operating using the new system called JAMStack which is an architecture of building static websites. 

Now all this is archived with a couple addition technologies like the static site generetor netlify and eleventy.

The starting files used by [Xavier K Muneku] in the `Zed-Code-Mentor` folder are:

- `src` folder which is basically the source folder containing all the files listed below.
- `html files` like `index.html` and others contained in the `pages` folder which are to be used as base for different page layouts. These can be turned into templates that will be used.
- `css` folder contains three CSS files for styling the pages.
- `assets` has all the documents, images and logos. 
- Each `html file` has a `script tag` containing some simple `javascript` which keeps the copyright year updated.
